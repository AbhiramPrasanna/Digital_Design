## Repository Overview

This repository contains Verilog HDL codes that cover various aspects of digital design, starting from fundamental gates and progressing towards more complex modules like adders and ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units).

## Getting Started

To explore or use the codes in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-design.git
   cd digital-design
   ```

2. Navigate through the files and directories to find specific Verilog modules and their corresponding testbenches.

3. You can simulate and test these modules using an HDL simulator like Icarus Verilog or ModelSim.
